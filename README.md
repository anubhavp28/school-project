Class 12th - End Project for Computer Science

Wanted to preserve it, so uploaded it on github.

# How to build?
Well, It was written for Turbo C++ Compiler. The compiler is obsolete now, and won't run on any modern OS. Maybe try NDTC - https://ndtc-7eac7.firebaseapp.com/. NDTC is a preconfiged virtualised environment for running Turbo C++ compiler, with a modified Notepad++ IDE. NDTC is only for Windows Operating System. NDTC, also happens to be something I created back in grade 12th for personal use (have lost it's source code).
